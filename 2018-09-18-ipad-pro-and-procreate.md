## iPad Pro and Procreate

Been trying out some new art styles and ideas:

![A squid named Squiddly]({{site.baseurl}}/Squiddly_-_Color_Corrected-tiny.jpg)
This little guy's name is Squiddly...


![Style test - an aquatic plant]({{site.baseurl}}/alt-long-leaf-weed-tiny.jpg)
Testing out drawing style - one of the magic tools I'm finding is to do an alpha lock on an existing drawing/shape and then go on to shade/texture it.  

![Fish swimming around under some lilypads]({{site.baseurl}}/Fish_Under_Lilly_Pads-tiny.jpg)
The level of brush detail you can express using Procreate and the Apple Pencil is really great - You can zoom way in and start to see and pick up on digital artifacts that a traditional brush and ink wouldn't do, but all that is outweighed by being able to use the magic of CTR-Z (or, since it's Procreate, two finger tap!)
