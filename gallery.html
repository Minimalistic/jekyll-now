<!-- This is a very rudimentary, starter image gallery that is generated from
     all images located in images/backgrounds - The accompanying 'code' to this
     can be found in the `_config.yml` under `defaults`-->

    <!-- Below is used to embed images from images/backgrounds -->
    <div class="image_gallery">
        {% assign image_files = site.static_files | where: "image", true %}
        {% for myimage in image_files %}
            <img alt="test" src={{ myimage.path}} width="25%">
        {% endfor %}
    </div>
