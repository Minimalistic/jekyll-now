I've been working through various React tutorials, made a quick variation of the Tic Tac Toe game from one of the main intro tutorials for React [intro tutorials for React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Added some CSS hover for a bit of added color and responsiveness. Also made it responsive to window size, scaling up the text and game board grid accordingly.

Here's a little example screen-cap I did of the app:
