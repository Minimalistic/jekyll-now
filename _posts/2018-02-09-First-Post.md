After going down the very deep rabbit hole of all of all things [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) I think I've settled on a nice and simple setup.

For simplicity, I started the design from an excellent starting repo [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by [@barryclark](www.github.com/barryclark). 

Next steps:
- Embed or separately integrate my Graphic Design portfolio in some way.
- Flesh out the excellent static page resume using a fork from the repo [resume-template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template) by jglovier.
- Embed or separately integrate Photography portfolio.
- Restyle the theme for this Jekyll site.
- Further flesh out the site itself, see about embedding social media activity feed etc.
