After going down the very deep rabbit hole of all of the things that [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) I think I've settled on a nice and simple setup.  Initially I had created and had a working Jekyll static page setup on Github Pages but because of a few things I don't quite understand as-of-yet, I managed to break it beyond my willingness to fix it.Â TLDR: When one generates a new static blog with Jekyll, the folder directory is not entirely fleshed out to show everything that it _actually_ uses and relies on. I think this is done as a means of streamlining for the user, but when one wants to say, modify a part of the theme that's currently in the Jekyll build it can be a bit confusing - at least for mere mortals.

Regardless, instead of going through the motions of command-lining away and generating a new Jekyll blog I decided instead to fork off from an excellent starting repo [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by [@barryclark](www.github.com/barryclark). 

Next steps:
- Embed or separately integrate my Graphic Design portfolio in some way.
- Flesh out the excellent static page resume using a fork from the repo [resume-template](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template) by jglovier.
- Embed or separately integrate Photography portfolio.
- Restyle the theme for this Jekyll site.
- Further flesh out the site itself, see about embedding social media activity feed etc.
