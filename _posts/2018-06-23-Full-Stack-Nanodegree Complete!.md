The last project for my Udacity Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree program was officially approved after review - It's official!  My next step is going to be doing some looking around at the different services out there like [Hacker Rank](http://www.hackerrank.com) and [Exercism.io](http://www.exercism.io), I definitely could use some rounding out of my programming skills and those seem to be really solid on doing that.

This little animated gif is the latest project that was accepted for the last Udacity project, it has the ever creative name of [Jasons Technical Interview Practice Project](https://github.com/Minimalistic/Jasons-Technical-Interview-Practice-Project)
