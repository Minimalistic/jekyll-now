I'm in the process of updating my resume and projects and realized I wasn't showcasing any my activities in 3D modeling.  Now that I have some of them uploaded to Youtube, I can easily embed them in things!

These were all done in Zbrush, a really great modeling program and the actual sculpting was primarily done using a Wacom Intuos tablet which is *extremely* helpful when modeling organically as you get one extra layer of control over the modeling via pressure of the stylus.
