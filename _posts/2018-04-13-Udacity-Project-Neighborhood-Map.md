I just completed my latest probject - Neighborhood Map Filming Locations, a little web app that displays a map of New York using Google Maps and populates across it a number of different famous filming locations. You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/Minimalistic/Neighborhood_Map_Filming_Locations) or even [play around with the live app here!](http://jasonhmarsh.com/Neighborhood_Map_Filming_Locations/)

It's been a great learning experience, I am starting to understand Javascript more but I have to admit that the more I work with Javascript, the more I appreciate Python.  Regardless, they all have their uses in one way or the other.
